# The problem

This is what your API returns

```json
{
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": null,
        "name": "Item 1"
      },
      {
        "id": null,
        "name": "Item 2"
      },
      {
        "id": null,
        "name": "Item 3"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# What is actually returned ⚠️

If you call the `useQuery` that is provided in apollo ( version: `"apollo-client": "2.6.10"`), this is what you get in the response.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": null,
        "name": "Item 1"
      },
      {
        "id": null,
        "name": "Item 1" <--- should be Item 2
      },
      {
        "id": null,
        "name": "Item 1" <--- should be Item 3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
