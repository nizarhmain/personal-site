# How to debug from rails from the console

Imagine you have this

```ruby
class Dog
  def speak
    "woof"
  end
end
```

```ruby
module LoudDog
  def speak
    "WOOF!!!"
  end
end

Dog.prepend(LoudDog)

Dog.new.speak
# => "WOOF!!!"
```

Boom — speak is overridden!

Similarly you can do this

```ruby
module MyDebugPatch
  def find_virtual_account
    puts "🔍 Overridden find_virtual_account called"
    super
  end
end

Collection::OrderServices::CreateOrder.prepend(MyDebugPatch)
```
